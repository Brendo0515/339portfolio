        The Internship
      </h2>
      <p>
        As a business support intern, my role was to answer calls from professionals that were having technical issues with Thomson Reuters software.  
        The product I supported was called Accounting Creative Solutions, specifically the general ledger.  The software kept track of checks and payments, 
        bank reconciliations, report designs, accounts payable/receivable and more for each individual client.  The internship lasted 14 weeks from May to August.  
        During the first three weeks, we were trained to use the basic functionalities of the software, operate internal software that tracked and logged calls, and 
        handle different types of call scenarios.

        This internship taught me the importance of teamwork, collaboration, and keeping your head high while working long shifts.
        TR also set up fun and informative social events for the other interns.  We volunteered at a nonprofit organization by helping them move to their new location, we sat in on an interview with the CEO: Jim Smith,
        and we had a day where all the interns went bowling.  The intern events helped a lot with de-stressing and networking with other people in the company.
        Overall, I have nothing but great things to say about my experience working at Thomson Reuters.  Every day I really felt like I made a difference, and I hope to continue to do so in the future.
